#Savage GameEngine

A game engine that I built for my self, as I dont really
like the options that are avaliable to me, this game
engine does not use a GUI, and uses Java for programming
it will always be free and fully open source. Uses LWJGL 2
and glsl for shaders. I will be using this game engine to 
built a few games for my self and a friend once it is complete
###Purpose
The main purpose of this game engine is for me to learn how rendering
in technology such as shaders etc really works.
